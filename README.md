    Whether you own an extra or unused car or find yourself frequently looking for transportation when traveling, OnDemand car is a simple and easy to use website that allows you to rent out or rent a vehicle from others in your area! Making money for the former and easing the experience of travel for the latter. Unlike ride share apps, you have the ability rent a vehicle peer-to-peer OR begin earning passive income by renting out your own vehicle.

**Release Version** v1.0.0
> This project was created by request of the team's software engineering class at Northern Arizona University. Currently, this project is in it's alpha phase release version 1. The website's only main functionalities right now are to submit car info to rent or to rent out a car, and also to make an account. The design and implementation of the site is still preliminary and there will be more changes in the near future. This is just the simple base product of our system.
